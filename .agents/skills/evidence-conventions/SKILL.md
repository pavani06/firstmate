# evidence-conventions

Authority: these conventions were approved in the pavani06/fleet-lab lab (decisions DEC-004, DEC-005, and DEC-006, plus validator decision DEC-007, 2026-09-20) and graduated to fleet-wide operating norms by the captain.
This skill is the single owner of their substance; briefs, status scaffolds, and `AGENTS.md` carry only trigger pointers back here.
The conventions govern claims, not mechanisms: they grade what an agent asserts, and no parser or state machine changes because of them.

## Evidence states

Every claim that work is complete, in the free-text part of a status line, a report, a PR description, or an agent handoff, carries exactly one of these labels:

| Label | Meaning | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `reported done` | the agent says it did the work; nobody has verified it | any agent |
| `verified` | the verification was executed and its raw output is recorded (see measurement honesty below) | whoever holds the evidence |
| `not run` | the verification was not executed | any agent |

Rules:

- Fail-closed: a completion claim an agent writes in free text without a label is treated as `not run`.
  The rule grades agent-authored claims only; terminal lines emitted by firstmate machinery, such as the parent-channel publication of a child's terminal outcome, are protocol lines owned by the scripts that emit them and are never read as `not run`.
- `verified` without cited evidence is label abuse; the honest label is `reported done`.
- The labels are literal lowercase, with a space inside `reported done` and `not run`, so they stay greppable.

In a Firstmate status line the label lives in the free-text part after the state verb, and the state verb itself (`working`, `done`, `blocked`, and the rest) stays exactly as `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` defines it.
Fixed-shape gate lines are the exception: a scaffold that dictates a line byte-for-byte, such as a definition-of-done gate, is written exactly as the scaffold spells it, because anchored scrapes read those lines to recover the delivery and any inserted label text breaks the match.
Never add a label inside such a line, and never read its missing label as `not run`; what the line asserts comes from the gate itself.
The no-mistakes gate `done [at=<epoch>]: PR {url} checks green` is a `verified`-class claim whose cited evidence is the pipeline's green CI.
The direct-PR gate `done [at=<epoch>]: PR {url}` and the local-only gate `done [at=<epoch>]: ready in branch fm/<id>` are equally fixed-shape and equally label-exempt, but they assert no verification: their verification happens at the configured merge authority before the work lands.

## Bug verdicts

Every debug or fix report ends with exactly one nominal verdict: `verified`, `partial`, or `failed`.
The token `verified` belongs to the evidence states above; the bug verdicts are derived from them, never redefined:

- `verified` - the fix was exercised against the scenario that reproduced the bug, and its verification evidence carries the evidence state `verified` (command + raw output recorded).
- `partial` - the fix resolves part of the scenario; the residue is named and its evidence cited.
- `failed` - the fix does not resolve the bug, or its verification is missing or `not run`.

Fail-closed rule, coherent with the evidence states: missing or `not run` verification means `failed`.
There is no "presumably fixed": a fix without recorded verification is reported as `failed`, never as a success.
`diagnostic-reasoning` owns the structure of a diagnostic report; this verdict labeling applies on top of that structure.

## Measurement honesty

Any number cited to the fleet (percentage, count, tokens, latency, cost) references both:

1. the command that produced the number, and
2. the raw output, as a fenced block in the same document or a path to the recorded log.

Fail-closed: a number without its citation does not enter decisions, reports, or captain-facing summaries; a reader must be able to reproduce the number from the cited command.
"Should pass" is not a measurement; the honest phrasing names the verification that has not run yet.

In a durable measurement citation - a report, a decision record, a PR description - a wrong number is retracted, never erased: the original stays in place annotated with a dated retraction, the corrected number arrives with its own command + raw output, and git history is never rewritten to hide a measurement.
On a curated state surface that has its own owner (`learnings.md` rewrite-and-prune, task notes correct-or-delete), that owner wins and the figure is replaced in place; the replacement number still cites its command and raw output.

Lab config validator reference: pavani06/fleet-lab DEC-007 ships `experiments/config-validator/validate.py`, which rejects a YAML or JSON config on an unknown top-level key, naming the field and its probable match; schema and usage live in that lab's `docs/conventions/config-key-validation.md`, and the tool validates the lab's schema only, so it is not a dependency of any Firstmate path.
